## Supported .NET 6 Versions

> **SDK 6.0.428**
> The .NET SDK (Software Development Kit) is the recommended option if you plan to develop, build, test, or publish .NET 6 applications. It includes:
> - The .NET Runtime, which is required to run .NET apps.
> - The ASP.NET Core Runtime, so you can develop and host ASP.NET Core web applications out of the box.
> - The .NET CLI and build tools for compiling and managing your .NET 6 projects.
>
> With the SDK, you won't need to install separate runtimes for ASP.NET Core or the Desktop environmentâ€”everything is bundled together to streamline development and deployment.

> **ASP.NET Core Runtime 6.0.36**
> The ASP.NET Core Runtime contains the components needed to run ASP.NET Core web applications on .NET 6. It includes libraries and features for building dynamic web pages, RESTful APIs, and real-time communication with SignalR.
>
> *Note:* If you install the full .NET SDK, you already get the ASP.NET Core Runtime.

> **.NET Desktop Runtime 6.0.36**
> The .NET Desktop Runtime allows you to run Windows desktop applications built with Windows Forms or WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation). It focuses on providing a smooth experience for traditional graphical apps on Windows platforms.

> **.NET Runtime 6.0.36**
> The .NET Runtime is the base runtime required to run console or server-based .NET applications. It's more lightweight than the SDK, since it does not include compilers, build tools, or additional libraries for web or desktop development.
